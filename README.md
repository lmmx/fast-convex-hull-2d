# fast-conv-hull-2d

:running: SciPy 2020 sprint on scikit-image for a faster 2D convex hull algorithm :running:

There was a pull request (PR) proposing a faster convex hull algorithm, but it gave some
errors. This is discussed [in the sprint notes](sprint_notes.md), which includes an expository
intro with some literature references.

Now that the source of the bug was discovered during the sprint, the task is now to
fix it.

(Work in progress)
