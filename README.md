# fast-conv-hull-2d

:running: SciPy 2020 sprint on scikit-image for a faster 2D convex hull algorithm :running:

There was a pull request (PR) proposing a faster convex hull algorithm, but it gave some
errors. This is discussed [in the sprint notes](sprint_notes.md), which includes an expository
intro with some literature references.

- **Update:** after taking a break and revisiting this with fresh eyes, I'm now taking notes on
  the best solution [in the 'post-sprint notes'](post_sprint_notes.md)!
- **Update** pull request submitted! [See thread](https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/pull/2928#issuecomment-735432524)

Now that the source of the bug was discovered during the sprint, the task is now to
fix it.

(Work in progress)
